## Module Description

High level overview:

- `dsHdmiIn` provides a variety of `API`s for accessing information regarding the `HDMI` Inputs on sink devices and source devices that has an input port.
- It facilitates interaction with `HDMI` Input ports, aiding in their configuration and utilization within the system. This information is then passed to the caller.
- For the sink and source devices, to retrieve the available `HDMI` Input information, an external device must be connected.
